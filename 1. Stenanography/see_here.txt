There are three independent 1-bit images hidden in the least significant bit of every byte from each of the three color channels of the image.

Write a Python script called extract_hidden_images.py that:

Takes as a command line argument the name of an RGB mode PNG file. The program should print an error message and quit under the following circumstances:
- The name of the file was not provided as a command line argument.
- The provided file name doesn’t have a .png extension.
- An exception is raised when trying to open the image file. It’s important to specify the reason as part of the error message.
- The mode of the file is not RGB.
- Extracts from the red, green, and blue channels the corresponding hidden 1-bit images placing the result in three 1-bit PNG images with the 		 following suffixes after the original extensionless file-name :

1. file-name_channel_1_red.png
2. file-name_channel_2_green.png
3. file-name_channel_3_blue.png
